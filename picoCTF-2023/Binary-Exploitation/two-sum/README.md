What two positive numbers can make this possible: `n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2` <br>

## Approach

Looking at the C code, it seems that we have to provide 2 numbers that satisfies the above condition: `n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2`. If it was pure mathematics, it would be impossible.

However, based on the code, it appears that as long as `addIntOvf()` returns `-1`, we would obtain the flag. Hence, `result` variable would have to be negative, else the 2 numbers I provide would be negative.

```c
static int addIntOvf(int result, int a, int b) {
    result = a + b;
    if(a > 0 && b > 0 && result < 0)
        return -1;
    if(a < 0 && b < 0 && result > 0)
        return -1;
    return 0;
}
```

This would be an integer overflow problem, where the number is larger than the numeric value the variable is able to store. With this, it is possible for a large positive number to be regarded as a negative value.

Since the `result` variable is defined as `int`, the max value it is able to store is `2147483647` for a 32-bit integer.

As such, I can provide `a` and `b` large enough such that their sum is more than `2147483647`. Using `a = 1000000000` and `b = 1500000000`, I obtained the flag.
