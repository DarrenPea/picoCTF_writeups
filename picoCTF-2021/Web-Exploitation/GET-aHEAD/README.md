## Description

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/

## Approach

Using Burp Suite to intercept the requests, I noticed that after choosing Red, a `GET` request is being sent. Meanwhile, a `POST` request is being sent when I chose Blue.

I decided to try different HTTP methods to obtain the flag. As seen, the `HEAD` HTTP method allowed me to obtain the flag.
