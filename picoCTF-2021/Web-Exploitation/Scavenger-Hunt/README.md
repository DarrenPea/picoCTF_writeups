## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/. Can you find it?

## Approach

Upon viewing the sources of the webpage (Inspect Element), the flag seems to be hidden in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

HTML:
```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

CSS:
```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

Javascript:
```js
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

To prevent Google from indexing a website, `robots.txt` will usually contain instructions on which portions of the website web crawlers/robots are allowed to visit.

Accessing `http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/robots.txt`, the third part of the flag is obtained, and it also directs me to look into Apache.

```py
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

I then looked into `.htaccess`, which is a file in Apache to configure website permissions at the directory and subdirectory level.

At `http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/.htaccess`, I found the 4th part of the flag.

```py
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

Looking at system files generated by mac OS, I noticed a `.DS_Store` file, which stores custom attributes of its containing folder. 

Accessing `http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/.DS_Store`, I obtained the last part of the flag.

```
