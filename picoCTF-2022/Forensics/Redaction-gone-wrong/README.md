## Description

Now you DONâ€™T see me.
This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/84/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

## Approach

Upon downloading the PDF file, I used `pdftotext` to view the all texts in the file. This allowed me to obtain the flag in plaintext.

```
$ pdftotext Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf

$ cat Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.txt
Financial Report for ABC Labs, Kigali, Rwanda for the year 2021.
