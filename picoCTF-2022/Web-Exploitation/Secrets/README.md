## Description

We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? <br>
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:58736/).

## Approach

Upon inspecting the webpage, I noticed that the CSS and images are stored in the `secret/assets/` folder.

</p>

I then tried to view the contents of the `secret/` folder by going to `http://saturn.picoctf.net:58736/secret/`. It apepars that there is a folder in `secret/hidden/`, so I tried to view the content in it.

</p>

I viewed the contents of `hidden/` folder by going to `http://saturn.picoctf.net:58736/secret/hidden/` and noticed a login page. Upon inspection, the login page seemed to always provide an alert that the login as failed. I then noticed the `secret/hidden/superhidden/` folder.

</p>

After viewing `http://saturn.picoctf.net:58736/secret/hidden/superhidden/`, the flag is finally obtained in the HTML code.

```html
<body>
	<h1>Finally. You found me. But can you see me</h1>
	<h3 class="flag">picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_51b260fe}</h3>
</body>
```

## Flag

`picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_51b260fe}`
