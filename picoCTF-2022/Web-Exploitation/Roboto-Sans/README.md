## Description

The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it. <br>
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Check [this](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55148/) out.

## Approach

Since the description mentioned that the flag is not necessarily on the website, I decided to check the `/robots.txt` page of the website.

The first 3 lines of the second chunk of text appears to be base-64 encoded so using Cyberchef to decode each line, the following output is obtained.

```
										## base-64 decoded
ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW					## flag1.txtjs/myfi
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==					## js/myfile.txt
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg			## ²û,²ðzè°¡¡»/u«%z8
```

Upon visiting the `/js/myfile.txt` [page](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55148/js/myfile.txt), the flag is obtained.
