## Description

The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? <br>
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:62669/)

## Approach

Upon inspecting the page's HTML, I believe that that the flag is hidden within the HTML/CSS/JavaScript file.

What I found in the HTML:
```html
<!-- six_box
end six_box   The flag is not here but keep digging :)-- >
```

Looking through `css/style.css`, I found the flag.
```css
/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49} **/
```

## Flag

`picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49}`
