## Approach

I tried a basic SQL injection, where I logged in with the following credentials.

Username:`admin' --` <br>
Password: `test`

`--` comments out the rest of the query following it, hence the SQL query will return results where name is "admin".

It says that the flag is in plainsight, so I inspected the page and found the flag hidden inside the PHP file.
