## Description

Can you get the flag?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:59586/) and see what you can discover.

## Approach

After inspecting the website, it appears that the flag is hidden in the CSS and Javascript files.

CSS:
```css
/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

JS:
```js
//  f7w_2of2_6edef411}
```

Piecing both of them together, the flag is obtained.

## Flag

`picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_6edef411}`
