## Approach

Upon inspecting the log in portal, I noticed that when the `Submit` button is clicked, it submits the form to `login.php`.

As such, I visited http://saturn.picoctf.net:52584/login.php and realised that there is a file, `secure.js`, which checks for the password.

```js
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

As such, I tried logging in with username `admin` and password `strongPassword098765`, and managed to obtain the flag.
