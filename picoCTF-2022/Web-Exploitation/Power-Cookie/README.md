## Approach

Upon loading the webpage, we are prompted to continue as guest, but it tells us that there is no guest services at the moment. Looking at the session cookies, I noticed that there is a `isAdmin` cookie, whose value is set to `0`.

</p>

So, I tried to change `isAdmin` cookie value to `1`, which will be evaluated as `True`, and refreshed the webpage with `Ctrl + Shift + R`. This allowed me to obtain the flag.
