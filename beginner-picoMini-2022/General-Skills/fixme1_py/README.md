## fixme1.py

This challenge presents a syntax error in Python inside `fixme1.py`.

```python
flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')
  print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```

From the code above, there should not be an indent before the print statement. After resolving the issue, I obtained the flag.
