## Description

To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 29221.

## Approach

This challenge requires me to decode binary, octal and hex into ASCII. I have written a script using `pwntools` in `script.py` to solve the challenge.
