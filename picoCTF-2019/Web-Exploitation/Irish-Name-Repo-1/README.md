## Description

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:39720. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Approach

On the site, there is an admin login page, where a username and password is needed. So, I tried a few basic SQL injections to log in and obtain the flag.

User: `test` <br>
Password: `' OR '1'='1`

## Flag
