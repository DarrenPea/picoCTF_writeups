## Description

This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:26704

## Approach

When I try to connect to the browser and obtain the flag, I was greeted with the following response.

</p>

This problem likely requires us to change the `User-Agent` HTTP header, which identifies the OS and browser of client making the request. I would have to be rendering the website with the picobrowser.

Using Burp Suite, I intercepted the network request and changed the `User-Agent` HTTP header to `picobrowser` to obtain the flag.
