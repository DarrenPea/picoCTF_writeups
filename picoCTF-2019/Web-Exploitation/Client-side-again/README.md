## Description

Can you break into this super secure portal? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60786/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60786/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60786

## Approach

The login page seems to verify whether the password we typed is correct. Upon inspecting the page, I noticed that there is a script to verify the password.

</p>

I tried to deconstruct the verification script by arranging it and renaming variables.

</p>

I found out that the list is first being shifted, then I proceeded to find out which phrase belongs to which index and satisfy all the conditions to obtain the verified password.
