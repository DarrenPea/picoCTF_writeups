## Description

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/52849/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:52849

## Approach

Similar to Irish-Name-Repo 1, I tried using SQLi, where I input `' OR '1'='1` into the password field, but it says that SQLi is detected.

As such, I looked for other ways to login as admin and tried using `--`, which comments out the subsequent text, and managed to obtain the flag.

User: `admin' --`<br>
Password: `test`
