## Description

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915

## Approach

`robots.txt` files contains instructions for bots like web crawlers, to tell them which webpages they can/cannot access.

Going to `/robots.txt`, I found that a certain html webpage was disallowed.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```

I went ahead to visit `/8028f.html` and managed to obtain the flag.
