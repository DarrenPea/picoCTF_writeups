## Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

## Approach

Looking at the website, I noticed that there are 3 files provided to us, the website's HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Upon analysing them, I found these.

HTML:
```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

CSS:
```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

JavaScript:
```js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */
```

## Flag

`picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}`
