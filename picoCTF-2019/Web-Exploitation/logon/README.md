## Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796

## Approach

Upon entering the login page, i tried to logging in using `test` for both username and password.

Using Burp, it says that I logged in but do not have the flag.

</p>

Then, I noticed under `Cookie`, there was `admin=False`. As such, I changed it to `admin=True` and obtained the flag
