## Description

There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29132/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29132/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:29132. Try to see if you can login as admin!
## Approach

Upon reaching the admin log in page, I tried a basic SQL injection, `' OR '1'='1' --` and intercepted the response using Burp Suite.

I noticed that `OR` was replaced to `BE` so I tried `AB`, which was replaced with `NO`. As such, I think there is a shift cipher implemented. In order to replace `BE` with `OR` in the query, I would have to use `BE`, and I obtained the flag.
